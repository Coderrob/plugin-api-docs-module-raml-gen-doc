# Backstage.io Api-Docs Plugin: RAML to OpenAPI Renderer

## Overview

This is a plugin for [Backstage](https://backstage.io/) that extends the capabilities of the built-in API documentation feature by adding support for parsing and rendering [RAML](https://raml.org/) (RESTful API Modeling Language) definitions in [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/) format.

With this integration, Backstage users can seamlessly view and manage their APIs defined in RAML within the same familiar interface as OpenAPI.

## Features

- **Converts RAML to OpenAPI**: Automatically translates RAML API definitions into OpenAPI v2.0 specifications.
- **Easy Integration**: Designed to work seamlessly with existing Backstage setups and plugins.

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of Backstage.io setup.
- Node.js installed on your development machine (preferably the latest LTS version).
- Existing or planned RAML API definitions in your project.

## Installation

1. **Create a new Backstage application**

   ```bash
   npx @backstage/create-app@latest
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Navigate to your Backstage app directory and add this RAML to OpenApi plugin:

   ```bash
   cd path/to/your-backstage-app
   yarn --cwd packages/app add @coderrob/plugin-api-docs-module-raml-gen-doc
   ```

3. **Register the widget in Your App's `packages/app/src/apis.ts`**

   Add the following import statement to register the plugin with Backstage:

   ```typescript
   import {
    apiDocsConfigRef,
    defaultDefinitionWidgets,
   } from '@backstage/plugin-api-docs'

   . . .
   createApiFactory({
     api: apiDocsConfigRef,
     deps: {},
     factory: () => {
       const widgets = addRamlDefinitionWidget(defaultDefinitionWidgets());
       return {
         getApiDefinitionoWidget: ({ spec, { type }}: ApiEntity) =>
           widgets.find(widget => widget.type === type),
       };
     },
   }),
   . . .
   ```

4. **Restart Your Backstage App**

   After making changes, restart your Backstage application to see the new plugin in action:

   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

## Usage

1. **Add RAML Files**

   Place your RAML API definitions under a directory specified for API documentation within your Backstage catalog (e.g., `static/docs/api`).

2. **Navigate to API Docs**

   Access the API documentation section in Backstage.

3. **View Rendered OpenAPI Documentation**

   When an API entity is viewed the plugin will automatically convert the RAML definitions into OpenAPI format and render them using Backstage's built-in tools for a clean, interactive experience.

## Configuration

The plugin leverages Backstageâ€™s existing default Api widget definitions for API documentation. No additional configuration is required.
